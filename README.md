This study investigates energy consumption prediction in the PJM Interconnection LLC (AEP_hourly) dataset, spanning from December 31, 2004, to January 2, 2018, using a variety of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. Key performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), are employed to assess the models' accuracy. The results reveal that XGBoost yields the most accurate predictions with the lowest MAPE. The study's findings provide valuable insights into model selection for enhancing energy consumption forecasting in the context of PJM Interconnection LLC.
